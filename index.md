### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 (Part-2) was one of the first of many favorite labs. This mostly became my
    favorite because this was when coding brought out the creative side of me.
    It consisted of using ".jpg" images which were parking restrictions, the
    goal was to make a program tha determined whether street parking is allowed
    on that specific street using the images. After struggling and breaking the
    code multiple times, I learned how to build functions and familiarized myself 
    with using if-statements in C++. I will include a sample image of the signs
    used in this code!

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 (Part-2) was a new experience to me, since I was learning a bit of Java
    as well. I found it interesting because it used the combination of two-dimensional
    vector's with locations in California, where we are located at. This project consisted
    of creating a program that organized California's population data by county using the
    command line. The introduction to data structures was a topic I picked up creating this
    code as well as perfecting the 2D vector/array.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 (Part-2) was my all time favorite project to work on out of all the other labs.
    I mostly enjoyed this lab because it was one of the most challenging out of all the others.
    In this lab, we used our knowledge of random numbers and working with images. We created
    a GIF that was constructed from many different images. This created a "background noise"
    themed GIF. On top of this, we would implement a user defined message in a massive yellow
    text. This project taught me the use of the Mersenne Twister Engine and it's purpose of
    generating random numbers. It also refined my knowledge on nested for-loops. I will
    include a sample image of this project!
